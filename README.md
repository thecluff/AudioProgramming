# AudioProgramming

Audio programming basics done in C++

The culmination of this project is in ./ProjectBaseFinal.

Run the shell script titled "programManager.sh", and a complete mix will be created using the raw tonal audio stems generated with PureData, and percussion stems created with Logic Pro X.
